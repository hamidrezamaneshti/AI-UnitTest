# AI-UnitTest-Generator Software Ver 1.0.0

This project is designed to generate unit test cases for Python functions. To extract the functions, the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) structure was utilized. Subsequently, the OpenAI platform is prompted to generate unit test cases to assess the function. The software is equipped with a graphical user interface (GUI) that has been developed with the help of the Tkinter library. Also, I deployed this project with Dash library to use it in online.

## Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)
An abstract syntax tree (AST) is a data structure used to represent the abstract syntactic structure of code written in a programming language. It is a tree-like representation of the structure of the program's source code, where each node in the tree represents a construct in the code, such as a statement, expression, or function call. The nodes are interconnected in a hierarchical fashion, with the root node representing the entire program and the child nodes representing the various constructs within it.
In Python, for instance, an AST can be generated by passing ast.PyCF_ONLY_AST as a flag to the compile() built-in function, or by using the parse() helper provided in the ast module. The resulting AST is a tree of objects whose classes all inherit from ast.AST and can be compiled into a Python code object using the built-in compile() function. The figure below shows An overview of the Syntax-Flow and Variable-Flow Generation.

### Role of AST in unit test case generation
Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) can play an important role in generating effective unit tests. As described in a study on an artificial system, the approach using ASTs can generate unit tests that achieve higher coverage and are easier to read and understand compared to current techniques based on mocking. Similarly, in a paper on automated unit test case generation tools, ASTs can be used to guide the generation of synthetic test cases intended to identify flaws in code and improve test-driven development. By analyzing the structure of code using an AST, it is possible to identify areas of code that require testing and generate test cases that cover different branches and conditions within the code.
In summary, ASTs can be utilized in automated unit test generation to improve test coverage and readability. By analyzing the structure of code, ASTs can guide the generation of test cases that effectively identify flaws and improve the quality of code.


### Using AST with machine learning to generate unit test cases
ASTs (Abstract Syntax Trees) can be used in the context of test case generation in combination with machine learning techniques. Specifically, embedding machine learning techniques into a coverage-directed test generation (CDG) framework can effectively automate the test generation process, making it more effective and less error-prone. CDG is a technique that uses an AST to guide the generation of test cases that cover specific parts of the code.

## Recipes
To run this project, it is necessary to install certain libraries.

`pip install tkinter`
`pip install openai`

To use the OpenAI API in the UnitTestGenerator.py module, it is required to add your own API key for the OpenAI platform. This can be accomplished by replacing the api_key variable in the __init__ function with your own unique API key.

`self.api_key = "Your OpenAI API"`
